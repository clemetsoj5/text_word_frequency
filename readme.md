# Text Word Frequency

Used to count the frequency of popular words in a text file.

## Background

Many writers are concerned with the amount of times they use specific words in their text. This program allows them to find out the top 10 most frequently used words to determine if they need to be concerned with their word choices and consider alternative language.

## Install

This project uses [node](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```
$ npm install --global tkinter re itertools python3
```

## Usage

To use this program, please run the python file text_word_frequency.py. This will then prompt the user to select a particular text file using the file explorer. After selecting a text file, that will be the input to the program. The output will be printed to the console and include all the words that are frequented the most. There is a sample input text file within the Sample Input folder that can be used to try the program out.
